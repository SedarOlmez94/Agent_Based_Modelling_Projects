Abstract
The earliest Holocene occupation of Orkney is still poorly understood, a lack of obvious sites meaning that it has, to date, undergone inadequate representation in the wider research agenda. This proof-of-concept study seeks to develop a ground-up modelling environment using advanced computational techniques in order to place Mesolithic activity within a realistic landscape setting. Constrained variables pertaining to the base physical character produce initial insights into site placement and exploratory movement. This lifts topography and terrain from a passive backdrop to play a more reactive position within Mesolithic studies, moving away from the static frameworks of previous analyses. The application of this robust ground-up approach can be used to test hypotheses and allows the development and layering of more complex input factors, in order to progress research by addressing further questions. The approach promotes understanding of post-glacial Orkney and is widely applicable to other situations around the globe.
