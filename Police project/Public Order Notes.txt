- police force areas shape file 


- incorporate actual connections between regions 
	- only adjoining regions connected 
	- weight by road distance from region A - region B 
	- calibrate road distances from google maps API 


- at region level include new variables
	- store n number of resource type - resourceA, resourceB etc
	- store percentage of unit type public order trained 
	- delay to mobilise variable in cycles - i.e. resources at this location can't do anything for X cycles (random between 0-10 for now) 

- incorporate functionality to:
	- ASSUMING one event!
	- identify regions that can provide resources within timeframe X to location A
	- list availability of resources over time - within 1 cycle 100 units (from region A,Q), within 2 cycles 350 units (from region A,Q, K, R, H)
	- produce list of movements 
		i.e. at cycle 1 move 400 units from region A to region D (this will take 3 cycles) 
	        at cycle 2 move ......


	- think about functionality to prioritise despatch of resources based on preference to minimise / maximise impact on a selected resource type 
		- I.e. we need 500 units at region X within 10 cycles minimising impact on type resourceA



	-ASSUMING multiple events
	- what happens if there are two or more events you need to respond to?
	- ADVANCED - what happens if event A happens at cycle 1, and then event B happens at cycle 3 - this would likely include functionality where units actually moved  


WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES?
