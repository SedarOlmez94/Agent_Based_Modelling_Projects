(SCENARIO)
CRIME:
- 100 units_required
- minimise_impact = ResourceB
- resources_requirement_cycles = 4


calculate T for all forces
crime occurs somewhere CRIME_LOCATION

create list M with all resources with T <= resources_requirement_cycles
delete from M all forces where not(minimise_impact) = 0

loop until units fulfilled or resources_requirement_cycles = 0

	find in M resource with min(t) AND max(M(not(minimise_impact))) 
	#Finding the maximum resource value which is not the minimise impact 
	#resource call this resource 1A


	X = [1A]

	if for all resources in X there exists a t = 0 then subtract 
		resource with t = 0 from units_required
	
	if units_required <= 0 then [print "crime prevented" break]
	
	subtract 1 from all resource times in X

	M = M - 1A




max(array):
	max = array[0]
	for i in range (M):
		if (M[i] > max):
			max = M[i]
	return max
