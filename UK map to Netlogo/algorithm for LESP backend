(SCENARIO)
CRIME:
- units_required = 20
- minimise_impact = B
- resources_requirement_cycles = 4


calculate T for all forces
crime occurs somewhere CRIME_LOCATION

1- create list M (array) with all resources with time-to-mobilise <= resources_requirement_cycles
2- delete from M all forces where not(minimise_impact) = 0 (no resources of resource to be used i.e. A in this case)

3- loop untill units_required = 0 or resources_requirement_cycles = 0:

4- 	find in M resource with min(time-to-mobilise) "smallest time to mobilise" AND max(M(not(minimise_impact))) = 1A "maximum 
5-  value of the resource which is not the one to minimise_impact on stored in M" 

6- 	(new list object) X = [1A] (add "1A to X")

7- 	if for all resources in X there exists a time-to-mobilise = 0 then subtract 
8- 		resource with time-to-mobilise = 0 from units_required
	
9- 	if units_required <= 0 then [print "crime prevented"
10- 	print names of all forces resources pulled and amount of resources pulled. BREAK]

11- 	subtract 1 from all resources time-to-mobilise in X

12- 	M = M - 1A remove the force added to X from the list M.




max(array):
	max = array[0]
	for i in range (M):
		if (M[i] > max):
			max = M[i]
	return max
