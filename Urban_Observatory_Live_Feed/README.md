Mesa is modular, meaning that its modeling, analysis and visualization components are kept separate but intended to work together. The modules are grouped into three categories:


- Modeling: Modules used to build the models themselves: a model and agent classes, a scheduler to determine the sequence in which the agents act, and space for them to move around on.
- Analysis: Tools to collect data generated from your model, or to run it multiple times with different parameter values.
- Visualization: Classes to create and launch an interactive model visualization, using a server with a JavaScript interface.
